# OpenCalendly v1.0.0 Release Notes

Release date: 27 Feb 2026 (IST)

## Highlights

- Core one-on-one scheduling with timezone-aware public booking links.
- Reschedule/cancel tokenized self-service flows with idempotent behavior.
- Team scheduling modes (`round_robin`, `collective`) with correctness-safe assignment writes.
- Demo credits pool + waitlist flow for free-tier demand control.
- Embeds + webhook delivery with retry/backoff and signature headers.
- Calendar sync hardening (Google + Microsoft) and booking lifecycle writeback retries.
- Analytics + operator dashboard v1.
- Reliability hardening:
  - branch protection + PR-only merges
  - public API rate limiting
  - mutation idempotency (`booking_create`, `team_booking_create`, `booking_reschedule`)

## Migration notes

1. Pull latest `main` and install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
2. Ensure environment is populated:
   - `cp .env.example .env`
   - fill required values (Neon, Cloudflare, OAuth, Resend)
3. Validate env:
   - `npm run env:check`
4. Apply DB changes:
   - `npm run db:generate`
   - `npm run db:migrate`
5. Seed baseline demo data (optional but recommended for smoke testing):
   - `npm run db:seed`
6. Run verification suite:
   - `npm run ci`
   - `npm run test:smoke`
7. Start services and verify:
   - API: `npm run dev:api`
   - Web: `npm run dev:web`

## Breaking/behavioral changes to note

- Booking create, team booking create, and reschedule now require `Idempotency-Key`.
- Public booking/availability routes return deterministic `429` under rate limits.
- `DATABASE_URL` enforcement is Neon-only for local/runtime DB connectivity.

## Post-upgrade checks

- Confirm webhook signatures on receiver side.
- Confirm calendar sync status (`GET /v0/calendar/sync/status`).
- Confirm writeback runner can process pending jobs (`POST /v0/calendar/writeback/run`).
